//Never declare a variable twice or two variables having the same name in one file
//On declaring constants(const) make sure to always asign it with a value otherwise it will give you an Error 
//And constant values dont change once assigned
//Variable names should not start with numbers
//Variable names should not have spaces inbtwn
//Variable name should not start with special characters like &,*,#,@,!
//Always Use variable names that are related to what you're doing
//Endevour to terminate at every end of a statement
//Incases when the variable name has more than one word: Use underscore(_) or camel notation(case)
//It is not advicable to use capital letters to begin or end a variable name
//White/blank spaces are allowed in programming.
//Comments are helpful in programming endevour to use them
//A file in javaScript that has code is called a module 
let firstName;
firstName = "Fauzia";
const num1 = 12;
